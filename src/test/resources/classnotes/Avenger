  ---productListVerification feature file


  ---how can i run it through maven? (maven + parallel)
           to run thru maven i need one thing -> surefire plugin (enables maven feature and parallel testing)

        7.2.3 versiyon değiştir

        //run from maven-> it tyries to run it parallelly but driver class is not eligible.
        //run from cukes runner -> runs it in sequence

        update Driver class

        For paralle test execution i need 2 things -> sure fire plugin + proper Driver class (with InheratbeLocalThread class)

        Run from cukes runner -> ask how many browser is gonna be opened?

        mvn test -> how many browsers?  why 2 ?

        ***even if u have eligible Driver class and have necessary plugin in pom.xml , unless u trigger the code from maven u can not achieve parallel testing!!!

        --delete cukesRunner tag and run from maven (it overrides the cukesRunner, no matter which tag is located there)

  ---Edit Run configurations dont type mvn and double quotes


  ---Add cucumber pretty REPORT
        we need 2 things to have this report
        1-me.jvt plugin
        2-modify cukes runner to generate report folder

        run from cukesRunner or mvn doesnt matter it generates report

        for local executions these 2 is enough
        for jenkins cucumber plugin we will need 1 more thing .json file


  ---push it into github (önce commit ve push yap)
         show that it is public and use that repo

        /*manage remotes deyip bağı kes
        share project on github
        change visibility to public*/

        jenkins create project and build

        cucumber report olmayacak

        intellij e dön json file ekle push yap

        tekrar jenkinsten build ve raporu gör
